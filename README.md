## Note: this repo contains all the projects i will use ai tools to analyze and understand and visualize raw dataset.  
### Purpose of this repo:
      using AI TOOLS like [BING, BARD] for mimicing how 'd a real data analyst work and tackle a project in the real life starting with:  
      1- dealing with the client or the customer or the data owner.  
      2- studying the domain related to the dataset, espically when the anlyst is someone with no domain ( a tech graduate).  
      3- setting the base for approaching the dataset to meet the right track for solving the problem or answering the client question.  
      4- using AI tools as a replacement for the clients to mimic how 'd a real client approach the analyst with predicting the possible cases of working with clients from people with a problem to clients with   
         questions to be answered to clients with a certain target to be achieved like stopping the loses till the client that doesn't know what on earth does he wants.  
      5- trying and testing the prompts till reaching the suitable one ( atleast for the current project).

## Note: don't skip a readme.
