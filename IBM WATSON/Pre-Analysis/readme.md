# the pre-analysis is the stage before any analyst works on the data analysis.
## Explaning the files:
    0- before the project: using AI to explain the domain concepts related to the dataset with providing sources for learning them.   
    
    1- marketing and customers for kids: simplifying the domain concepts and explaining them for a 13 years old kid ( for better understanding atleast for me).  
    
    2- data dictionary: making the data dictionary in a table format [containing field id, field name, describtion, data type, example of the data] from only row 
       data with no describtion for the dataset on the source site.  
       
    3- ibm dataset normalizaiton: dividing the dataset into small tables with a blink of an eye using AI to make it easier for the analysis ( in this dataset case           it's not required)  
    
    4- analytical questions: asking AI after understanding the dataset to provide an analytical questions for basic understanding of the dataset before any main     
       analysis ( knew it from a 5 years of experinece analyst at a guest speaker event).  
       
    5- the email: asking the AI to be the client in one of the many secnarios and sending me an email with what the client wants.  
    
    6- cheat step by step: in case the email is complex i asked the ai tell step by step what should be done in what order and how to approach the project.

## Note: this approach for me is what i will always follow in any project i will do from now on unless a better guidance appears.
